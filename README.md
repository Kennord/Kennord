- 👋 Hi, I’m Ken Mabiri.
- 👀 I’m interested in web designing and many other fields not related to it.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a frontend and backend designer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that require even learners to work on them. 
- 📫 You can reach me via email at kennord1@gmail.com, ThAnks !
